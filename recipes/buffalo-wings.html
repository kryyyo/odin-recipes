    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Buffalo wings made simple in an Instant Pot速 and without the fry. The Instant Pot速 cooks these to perfection. They hold together for easy handling but as soon as you sink your teeth into them, they are fall-off-the-bone tender. Serve with carrot sticks, celery, and ranch if desired.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>2 pounds of chicken wings</li>
        <li>3/4 cup buffalo wing sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon dry rach dressing mix</li>
    </ul>    

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour water into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot速). Set trivet inside and place wings on top. Secure the lid, seal, and select Manual setting. Cook on high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Mix wing sauce and ranch dressing mix in a large bowl. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid carefully. Transfer wings to the bowl of sauce using tongs. Toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Place a wire baking rack over the foil-lined baking sheet and arrange wings on top.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to high. Broil wings for 5 minutes. Flip wings and cook until crispy, about 5 minutes more. Toss with any remaining sauce if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Instead of ordering pizza for your next party, wow your guests with these crispy, caramelized, pizza-flavored cheese chips! Since everybody agrees that the best parts of a pizza are those spots where the cheese sort of drips off and caramelizes onto the pan, getting crispy, crusty, and incredibly delicious, I took those cheesy drips and made chips! Serve as-is or top with a bit of baby arugula and fold in half to eat like tacos.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>4 ounces provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup prepared pizza sauce</li>
        <li>30 slices pepperoni</li>
    </ul>    

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 13x18-inch, half-sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Grate provolone and mozzarella cheeses with the larger side of a box grater into a large bowl. Use the smaller side and grate in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Toss with your hands to combine.</li>
        <li>Scoop tablespoonfuls of the cheese mixture into 12 circular piles on the prepared baking sheet, making sure you're getting all three cheeses in each scoop. Top each circle with about 他 teaspoon pizza sauce, then place a slice of pepperoni on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until melted and sizzling, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove parchment paper and chips to a wire rack to cool. Line the baking sheet with a fresh sheet of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Repeat Steps 3 to 5 to bake remaining 18 chips.</li>
        <li>Let chips cool to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the parchment paper and serve.</li>
    </ol>
